      <h2>Fileserver</h2>
      <p>One of the main functions is the network storage. Every channel can have their own file depot that can be used just like (and even by) the well-known windows explorer or mac finder. Drop files, create folder, publish files in the channel and so on. Users subscribed to the individual channel can browse through and download the files. If you wish to give individual users or user groups specific rights for file access you can do so in the administration area that is clean and intuitive <a href="protonet_easy">simple</a>.</p>

      <h2>Collaboration</h2>
      <p>Users cannot only use the channels to exchange files; they can also inform about and discuss topics regarding each channel. Files can be published in the channel to be noticed, messages can be quoted, individuals can be addressed by name, links can be exchanged, video conferences can be held (soon), <a href="protonet_social">and so on</a>.</p>
      <p>There is no need to be in the local area network to use the channels. Since the protonet is accessible by any browser people can log in <a href="protonet_everywhere">everywhere</a>.</p>
